   abstract = {At the end of December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan city, China. As of April 15, 2020, >1.9 million COVID-19 cases were confirmed worldwide, including >120,000 deaths. There is an urgent need to monitor and predict COVID-19 prevalence to control this spread more effectively. Time series models are significant in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and taking the necessary measures to respond to this crisis. In this study, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were developed to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 prevalence of Italy, Spain, and France, the most affected countries of Europe. The prevalence data of COVID-19 from 21 February 2020 to 15 April 2020 were collected from the World Health Organization website. Several ARIMA models were formulated with different ARIMA parameters. ARIMA (0,2,1), ARIMA (1,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) models with the lowest MAPE values (4.7520, 5.8486, and 5.6335) were selected as the best models for Italy, Spain, and France, respectively. This study shows that ARIMA models are suitable for predicting the prevalence of COVID-19 in the future. The results of the analysis can shed light on understanding the trends of the outbreak and give an idea of the epidemiological stage of these regions. Besides, the prediction of COVID-19 prevalence trends of Italy, Spain, and France can help take precautions and policy formulation for this epidemic in other countries.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we have applied the univariate time series model to predict the number of COVID-19 infected cases that can be expected in upcoming days in India. We adopted an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model on the data collected from 31st January 2020 to 25th March 2020 and verified it using the data collected from 26th March 2020 to 04th April 2020. A nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) neural network was developed to compare the accuracy of predicted models. The model has been used for daily prediction of COVID-19 cases for next 50 days without any additional intervention. Statistics from various sources, including the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and http://covid19india.org/ are used for the study. The results showed an increasing trend in the actual and forecasted numbers of COVID-19 cases with approximately 1500 cases per day, based on available data as on 04th April 2020. The appropriate ARIMA (1,1,0) model was selected based on the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) values and the overall highest R2 values of 0.95. The NAR model architecture constitutes ten neurons, which was optimized using the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization training algorithm (LM) with the overall highest R2 values of 0.97.},

   abstract = {Purpose Coronavirus disease is an irresistible infection caused by the respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first found in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and has since spread universally, causing a constant pandemic. On June 3, 2020, 6.37 million cases were found in 188 countries and regions. During pandemic prevention, this can minimize the impact of the disease on individuals and groups. A study was carried out on coronavirus to observe the number of cases, deaths, and recovery cases worldwide within a specific time period of 5 months. Based on this data, this research paper will predict the future spread of this infectious disease in human society. Methods In our study, the dataset was taken from WHO "Data WHO Coronavirus Covid-19 cases and deaths-WHO-COVID-19-global-data". This dataset contains information about the observation date, provenance/state, country/region, and latest updates. In this article, we implemented several forecasting techniques: naive method, simple average, moving average, single exponential smoothing, Holt linear trend method, Holt-Winters method and ARIMA, for comparison, and how these methods improve the Root mean square error score. Results The naive method is best suited as described over all other methods. In the ARIMA model, utilizing grid search, we recognized a lot of boundaries that delivered the best-fit model for our time series data. By continuing the model, future predictions of death cases indicate that the number of deaths will increased by more than 600,000 by January 2021. Conclusion This survey will support the government and experts in making arrangements for what is about to happen. Based on the findings of instantaneous model, these models can be adjusted to guide long time.},
